> The CSAW Application Security Challenge is a cyber attack competition loosely based on the DefCon Capture the Flag Prequals. Participants will be given a series of challenges divided into different categories, each worth a specified number of points. This year, the competition will focus equally on Web Application security, Reversing and Exploitation. Make sure you are a jack-of-all-trades or put together a team with a diverse skill set.

We have participated CSAW 2009, which was hosted by NYU-Poly, in the past two days.

We ranked 1st and 2nd.

Since the regulation said that we are allowed to have only 4 people per group, we split our group into two: Undergrad team (ppop) and Grad team (CMU).

Both teams did excellent job in the competition.

Following is a final result of scoreboard _before_ bonus points have been awarded:
