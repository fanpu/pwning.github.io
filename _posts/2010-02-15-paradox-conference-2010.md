Paradox Conference (PadoCon) 2010 is an annual international hackers conference in Korea.

We&#8217;ve participated Capture The Flag competition this year.

There are a pre-qualification round (online) and a final round (offline).

We&#8217;ve earned 3rd place out of 100+ international teams.

**  
Here&#8217;s the result (Top 10 teams):**

Points in parenthesis represent the breakthrough scores, which can be earned by solving the problem before any other teams solve.
