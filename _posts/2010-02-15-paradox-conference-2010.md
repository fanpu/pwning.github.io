Paradox Conference (PadoCon) 2010 is an annual international hackers conference in Korea.

We've participated Capture The Flag competition this year.

There are a pre-qualification round (online) and a final round (offline).

We've earned 3rd place out of 100+ international teams.

There is a final round for the teams who are in top 6, but we declined since we cannot make it to Korea to compete.

Also, once the competition is over, we've managed to solve every problem that was released during the competition.  (We solved 18 of the 21 during the competition.)
