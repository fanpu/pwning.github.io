## Overview

[`bin100`][1] is a zip file containing modified ssh binaries and an encrypted password dump. Flipping the bits of the password dump reveals the plaintext and the key.

## Writeup

After downloading the binary, we unzip it to find 3 files: modified versions `ssh` and `sshd` and a binary blob `mac.h`. We noticed that flipping the bits of `mac.h` gave us a plain text dump of passwords:

```
$ cat bitflip.py
import sys

for byte in open("mac.h", "rb").read():
	sys.stdout.write(chr(~ord(byte) &#038; 0xFF))
```

```
$ python bitflip.py

```

At this point, we got stuck for a while. We tried every string in the decrypted text with no luck so we started digging further. The format of the text dump and the name `mac.h` made it clear that this was a reference to [skynet][2]. We reversed all the modified functions in the ssh binaries and found that the ssh binary had a backdoor if one provided a password such that `crypt(password) == "xzoQHjF6pMZlY"`. We started brute forcing on our GPUs while we took another look to see if there was an easier way.

And then we learned that the key server was initially malfunctioning and one decrypted passwords was the key: `supr3m3p0w3r`.
