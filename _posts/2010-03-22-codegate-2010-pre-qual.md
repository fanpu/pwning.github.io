(For people who don&#8217;t know what Codegate is, it&#8217;s an annual hackers event/conference in Korea.)

The CTF competition was from March 13th 9:00am to 14th 9:00pm in KST, total of 36 hours.

The game style was that they open few problems in the beginning, then they release additional problems as time goes by and as teams solve them. There were 19 problems overall.

The fields that were covered was really wide, which include web hacking, forensics, binary analysis, etc.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  As you can see from above, the problems were numbered sequentially, and there&#8217;s a point for each problem right under them.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  You can also notice that there are three team names under each problem, representing the first three teams who solved the particular problem.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  (After the competition, the bonus points were given to the teams who were listed there. You get 5%,3%,and 1% of the problem&#8217;s points by solving the problem as the first, second, and third team, respectively.)

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      (CLG-T and Twitter declined &#8212; thus, the next two teams were up for the final round)
