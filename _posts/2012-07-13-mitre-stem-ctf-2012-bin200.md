### Writeup

We take a look at this program and very quickly see that its doing tricky stuff with signals and otherwise loops forever, printing nonsense. Looking at <tt>catch_alarm</tt>, we see it de-obfuscates and prints a string depending on what signal it catches. As it turns out, it just dumps the key if sent a SIGALARM.
