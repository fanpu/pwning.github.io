## Overview

[bin200][1] is program that prints nonsense forever and prints the key if sent a SIGALARM.

## Writeup

We take a look at this program and very quickly see that its doing tricky stuff with signals and otherwise loops forever, printing nonsense. Looking at `catch_alarm`, we see it de-obfuscates and prints a string depending on what signal it catches. As it turns out, it just dumps the key if sent a SIGALARM.

```
% ./testa &#038;
You probably thought that this deer was alive.
% kill -24 %1

% kill -9 %1
