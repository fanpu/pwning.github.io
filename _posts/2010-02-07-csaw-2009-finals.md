I know that very long time has been passed since CSAW&#8217;09.. but here it is <img src="http://ppp.cylab.cmu.edu/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  Overall, CSAW2009 was really exciting and fun ðŸ˜€
</p>

We met a LOT of people who are very passionate about security.  
To be honest, I expected to see little bit dorky/geeky + dry people there.  
But, I gotta say, they were really cool, funny and geeky AT THE SAME TIME :p

Anyways, the event we participated this year was Capture The Flag (CTF).  
It was basically only on solving problems, instead of having attack/defense network <img src="http://ppp.cylab.cmu.edu/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

To illustrate, we had three big categories and one problem for each:

  1. **Writing a Shellcode** &#8211; We were given the instruction manual for SuperH processor. For those who don&#8217;t know where SupherH is used, it&#8217;s used for Dreamcast. Then, we had to write a shellcode using the instructions for SuperH.
  2. **Reverse Engineering** &#8211; We were given a virtual image containing Windows XP with two snapshots; before/after infected by a virus. So, we had to figure out what the &#8216;virus&#8217; installed onto a computer and reverse engineer it to find out what it&#8217;s doing. After all, it was a Windows kernel driver communicating over IOCTL.
  3. **Java Applet** &#8211; Java Applet was given, and when decompiled, it contained over 700+ class files. And guess what. We had only 2 hrs. So, we haven&#8217;t had enough time to look closely into this problem.

Since the competition started little late, we didn&#8217;t have enough time. So, we couldn&#8217;t fully finish the problems by the time that it was over. We just sent whatever we had. (shellcode + analysis on driver) Yeah. We really thought we lost the competition so badly.

We couldn&#8217;t believe our ears when we heard that we have won the competition xD

I thank everyone who prepared and participated CSAW 2009.

Here&#8217;s some pictures I took before/during/after the competition:

After the competition is over, we had a lunch where all the sponsors of CSAW did presentation for recruiting:

And we went to Japanese Ramen Place:

Then, we came back to hotel closer to Airport:  
(I know.. we cannot live without computers)

=============================================================

Next day, we split up: I&#8217;ve went to NYC (since I lived 4 yrs in jersey) and others haven&#8217;t. So, they decided to have a tour.

I just took this picture while walking the street:

Meanwhile, I went to a cafe and&#8230; did my homework.. <img src="http://ppp.cylab.cmu.edu/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I met few old friends during the day <img src="http://ppp.cylab.cmu.edu/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  
but didn&#8217;t have a chance to take pictures, though.

Everyone gathered to Korean Town around 4:00pm, but cuz it was little early for dinner,  
we walked around few blocks:

<div id="attachment_122" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <img class="size-full wp-image-122" title="1407330549" src="http://ppp.cylab.cmu.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/1407330549.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="262" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    As you can read, it's "museum of sex"
  </p>
</div>

After we had AWESOME Korean food for dinner, we decided to experience some Korean culture ðŸ˜‰  
We went to karaoke:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-123" title="1399555955" src="http://ppp.cylab.cmu.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/1399555955.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="336" />

It was the first time I&#8217;ve ever went to karaoke with non-koreans, but I figured that it gets crazy and fun whomever you are going with.

Way back to hotel:
