### Overview

[challenge2][1] is an Linux x86 binary with a format string vulnerability. If our format string contains no common shells, it gets placed in bss so we can just jump directly to it.

### Writeup

We quickly find the interesting function and notice the obvious format string vulnerability (Some functions renamed for increased readability.)

[<img src="http://ppp.cylab.cmu.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-01-at-3.14.07-PM.png" alt="Vulnerable function" title="Vulnerable function" style="width:100%;" class="size-full wp-image-990" />][2] 

There are a couple of things we need to observe for this exploit:

  * The <tt>snprintf</tt> fills a buffer on the stack (there is actually a buffer overflow here we didn&#8217;t use but could have), so we can use it to get arguments we want on the stack.
  * The program will exit if it detects <tt>/bin/sh</tt>, <tt>/bin/bash</tt>, etc. in our string, so we cannot use shellcode with those as constants. Luckily, [my favorite shellcode][3] doesn&#8217;t have this problem.
  * Immediately after the <tt>snprintf</tt>, the function <tt>countdown</tt> makes another call to <tt>snprintf</tt>.
  * Our format string is initially placed in bss, which is at a known location and is executable.

But now we have everything we need for our exploit: we make a format string that overwrites the GOT address of <tt>snprintf</tt> to point to the area in bss with payload. The format string will have the form: <tt>shellcode + padding + addr_of_snprintf_got_hi + addr_of_snprintf_got_lo + format_string</tt>. Here is an exploit.
