Gitzino was the 400-point crypto problem for Ghost in the Shellcode 2014. It looked like a standard
"predict-the-RNG" problem: there's a PRNG, a card game, and hopefully the output it gives you
provides enough data about the internal state of the PRNG to predict the future and win the game
repeatedly.

But that's not how we solved it.

There are some things that work depressingly often in computers that would never work in real life.
One of them showed up in the game: buy -1 of an item, and gain the currency corresponding to that
item. In this case, we determined that we could \*bet\* a negative number of "gitscoins" on the
outcome of the game, and then just send it a "random" deck and secret. Then, probably, we would
lose the game and receive the gitscoins we had bet.

So, how did we do it?

1. Learn about Provably Fair
2. Check Balance
3. Play Video Poker

Rinse and repeat until you get enough Gitscoins. Occasionally you will accidentally win, but in
general this should work.
